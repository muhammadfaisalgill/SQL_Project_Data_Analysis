1)
You can use Aliases Noting name with Where,order by case But in Having 
clause that is not used
Aliases in HAVING:

Aliases cannot be used directly in the HAVING clause because the HAVING clause is evaluated before the SELECT clause as well.
Instead, you should repeat the expression or use a subquery/CTE to reference the alias.
Example:
-- This works because alias `total_salary` is used in ORDER BY

SELECT department_id, SUM(salary) AS total_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id
ORDER BY total_salary;

-- This will NOT work because alias `total_salary` is used in HAVING

SELECT department_id, SUM(salary) AS total_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id
HAVING total_salary > 50000;

-- Correct way: Repeat the expression in HAVING

SELECT department_id, SUM(salary) AS total_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id
HAVING SUM(salary) > 50000;


2)
you should put comma before starting Case satement
when using a CASE statement in the SELECT clause, it must be preceded by a comma if it is not the first column in the SELECT list.

Example:
Correct Usage:
SELECT 
    employee_id,
    department_id,
    -- Comma before the CASE statement
    CASE 
        WHEN salary > 50000 THEN 'High'
        ELSE 'Low'
    END AS salary_category
FROM employees;
